            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a Thinkful student expanding my front-end skills. Known for being adventurous and taking risks. Also known for being a jack of multiple trades. I canâ€™t sit still for long!</p>
            <p>I have been doing front-end work since middle school without realizing what I was actually doing. By bouncing around between graphic design, content development and coding, my creativity is fully expressed through web work.</p>

          <h1>Thinkful Projects</h1>
            <p>As a student with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I will be completing one new portfolio project a week. The above "About Me" is my first project from the course. The following is what I have completed, in chronological order.</p>
            <section class="project2">
              <h2>Hack the New York Times, Week 2</h2>
                <p>By "hacking" the NY Times using Developer Tools, I learned how to make live-edits to websites for effective debugging by inspecting elements.</p>

              <h2>Karma Landing Page, Week 3</h2>
                <p>The best way to learn is by copying. From cloning a portion of a landing page, I learned about semantic HTML and better ways to style.</p>
                <a href="http://twiggy848.github.io/thinkful-karma-landing-page/" target="_blank"><img src="images/karmaLanding.png" alt="Thinkful Project 3"></a>

              <h2>Responsive Design and Portfolio, Week 4</h2>
                <p>This portfolio project serves as an excellent moment to define myself as a developer and nicely concludes the HTML/CSS portion of the course.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="project5">
              <h2>jQuery Street Fighter, Week 5</h2>
                <p>As an introduction to jQuery, I have created a <a href="http://twiggy848.github.io/jquery-streetfighter/main.html" target="_blank">fun Street Fighter landing page</a> with a few animations and events.</p>
                <a href="http://twiggy848.github.io/jquery-streetfighter/main.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/streetfighter.png" alt="Thinkful Project 5"></a>
            </section>
            <section class="project6">
              <h2>Grocery List App, Week 6</h2>
                <p>Using jQuery, I made this grocery list app that will add, check off, and delete items. Fully-responsive.</p>

            <section class="project7">
              <h2>FizzBuzz, Week 7</h2>
                <p>As an introduction to Javascript, I wrote out the logic for a game called "FizzBuzz". In this game, the user is prompted for a number. The browser will then spit out "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both, or simply the number. The browser will instruct users to refresh the page and try again if the number is invalid.</p>

             <section class="project8">
              <h2>Hot or Cold, Week 8</h2>
                <p>Hot or Cold is a game where the user has to guess the number. The game will provide feedback as the user continues to make guesses. Thinkful provided all of the boiler plate for this project, so I was able to focus solely on creating functions and conditionals. This game was created using jQuery. If you check the console, you will see my process for debugging and problem solving.</p>

             <section class="project9">
              <h2>Quiz App, Week 9</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this exercise was the exploration of click events, arrays and conditional logic. I made a quiz about flowers because I like them :)</p>
